# Scenario

An ecologist studying a rocky shore at Phillip Island, in southeastern Australia, was interested in how
clumps of intertidal mussels are maintained [@Quinn-1988-137]. In particular, he wanted to know how densities of adult
mussels affected recruitment of young individuals from the plankton. As with most marine invertebrates,
recruitment is highly patchy in time, so he expected to find seasonal variation, and the interaction
between season and density - whether effects of adult mussel density vary across seasons - was the aspect
of most interest.

The data were collected from four seasons, and with two densities of adult mussels. The experiment
consisted of clumps of adult mussels attached to the rocks. These clumps were then brought back to the
laboratory, and the number of baby mussels recorded. There were 3-6 replicate clumps for each density
and season combination.

# Exploratory data analysis

Model formula:
$$
\begin{align}
y_i &\sim{} \mathcal{NB}(\lambda_i, \theta)\\
ln(\mu_i) &= \beta_0 + \sum_{j=1}^nT_{[i],j}.\beta_j\\
\beta_0 &\sim{} \mathcal{N}(2.4, 1.5)\\
\beta_{[1,2,3]} &\sim{} \mathcal{N}(0, 1)\\
\end{align}
$$

where $\beta_{0}$ is the y-intercept (mean of the first group),
$\beta_{[1,2,3]}$ are the vector of effects parameters (contrasting
each group mean to that of the first group and $T{[i],j}$ represents a
$i$ by $j$ model matrix is a model matrix representing the season,
density and their interaction on mussel recruitment.

Lots of unmeasured things could cause more variance. You could add more variables if you have more data. Ex: tidal mark where muscles sat at. Can we put a proxy for all unmeasured things? Yes. It is called adding a unit level random effect. One problem it can cause, statistical shrinkage, it is where means are drawn in to be similar caused by the unit level random effect addition.

#Another technic is using negative binomial instead of Poisson. It is a catchold for a lot of causes of overdispersion. It has a dispersion parameter to estimate instead of assume it is 1. It will prevent over-dispersion.

# Excessive 0's can also cause over-dispersion.

# For our case there were couple of 0's so the overdispersion was mostly caused by variance being higher than it should be (for Poisson it is equal to µ)

# We are going to be swapping Poisson with Negative Binomial. We need to come up with a new prior which will be dispersion prior (µ/variance) -> gamma( 0.01, 0.01) -> gamma( shape1, shape2) -> numbers are default for gamma and the parameters of it called shape1, shape2 you can increase the numbers if the data is very very overdispersed

# For the recruitment numbers it is 4.57 times higher or 357% more in Summer than Spring for High density areas that measurements occurred. We have strong evidence in increase in recruitment between Spring and Summer.

# 86% increase in recruitment between Spring and Autumn. We have strong evidence on increase in recruitment between Spring and Autumn.

# Recruitment in winter halved between Summer and Winter. Decreased 48%. We have strong evidence on the decrease.

# FOR LOW and HIGH DENSITY AREAS

# No evidence in Spring 

# The decrease (~56%) on Spring to Summer compared to High density Spring to Summer, Low density Spring to Summer has done 56% recruitment less than we expected from low density Spring to Summer. We can say that there is evidence of interaction between Spring and Summer. We have strong evidence.

# The Spring to Autumn suggests no evidence.

# The Spring to Winter suggests no interaction and provides similar decrease in Recruitment compared to High density Spring to Winter recruitment. There is strong evidence that supports.
